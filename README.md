# The U.S. NOAA Storm Data: Analysis of Most Harmful and Costly Damages
![har](img/storm3.JPG)


In this project, I explored the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâ€™s (NOAA) storm database, which represents characteristics of major weather events in the US. The charateristics include when and where the events occur and estimates of any health damage (i.e., fatalities and injuries) and economic damages (i.e., property and crop damages).


The research questions I have addressed in this analysis are as follows: 
1. Across the United States, which types of events are most harmful with respect to population health? 
2. Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?
